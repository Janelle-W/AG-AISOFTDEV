    "**Objective:** This notebook introduces Microsoft AutoGen, a powerful framework for creating multi-agent systems that solve tasks through conversation. You will learn how to set up a team of agents that can write code, execute it, and collaborate to achieve a user's goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Audience:** Software engineers attending the AI-Driven Software Engineering Program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Philosophy:** AutoGen's core idea is that many complex tasks can be solved by a team of specialized agents conversing with each other. It provides a flexible and powerful platform for defining these agents and orchestrating their interactions."
