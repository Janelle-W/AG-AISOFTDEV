    "# Day 5 - Lab 1: Tool-Using Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Build agents that can use external tools to accomplish tasks they cannot perform on their own, using both LangChain and custom Python functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 135 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "Welcome to Day 5! We are now shifting from using AI to build a traditional application to building applications that *are* AI. An 'agent' is more than just a prompt; it's a system that can reason, plan, and use tools to achieve a goal. In this lab, you will build your first simple agents using the flexible LangChain framework.\n",

    "## Step 1: Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We will set up our environment, which for today includes installing the `langchain`, `langchain-community`, and `tavily-python` libraries. Tavily is a search engine API optimized for AI agents, which we will use as our first tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Selection:**\n",
    "For agentic tasks that require reasoning and tool use, highly capable models are recommended. `gpt-4.1`, `o3`, `gemini-2.5-pro`, or open-source models like `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1` are excellent choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Helper Functions Used:**\n",
    "- `setup_llm_client()`: To configure the API client.\n",
    "- `get_completion()`: To send prompts to the LLM (though we'll mostly use LangChain's abstractions)."

    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  Import `TavilySearchResults` from `langchain_community.tools.tavily_search`.\n",

    "Congratulations! You have successfully built your first AI agents. You've learned how to give agents tools to extend their capabilities and, most importantly, how to build an agent that can reason about which tool to use for a specific task. This is the foundational skill for all advanced agentic workflows we will explore in the coming days.\n",
